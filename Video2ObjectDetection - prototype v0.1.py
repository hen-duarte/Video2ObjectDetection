Description: Computer Vision Component. This piece of software allows the extraction of
             real-world events in non-technological environments, where there is no data
             captured to a digitized system. This is a computer vision component, that
             uses YOLO algorithm (https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) to detect objects
             in a scene. Then it sends the list of detected objects per frame via HTTP
             via HTTP to a configurable (IP and port number).
